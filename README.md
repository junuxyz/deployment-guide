# 16x H100 LLM Inference Cluster

This repository tracks LLM deployment experiments, setup runbooks, and benchmark results on a 2-node cluster with **16x NVIDIA H100 GPUs** (8x H100 per node).

> **PS**: I was running an LLM inference series on X that ended up gaining a lot of traction. After posting to ask if anyone could volunteer cluster access, the team at Lambda reached out and gave us access to a 16x H100 cluster for a week which was crazy! We did a ton of speedrunning here. starting with a plain Ubuntu server, we set up all the K8s adapters and environment prerequisites from scratch for our experimentation

## What broke & How we fixed it

When we first deployed disaggregation, two separate issues blocked the workers. The RDMA Shared Device Plugin initially could not advertise `rdma/ib` until the host RDMA subsystem used shared network-namespace mode. After that was fixed, ordinary Calico Pods could see the verbs devices but still lacked a usable RoCE interface and Pod-specific GID, so UCX failed and NIXL could not transfer KV cache across prefill and decode workers. We fixed the Pod data path with a dedicated NV-IPAM pool (`qwen-roce-pool`) and pod-native RoCE interfaces using Multus and MacVLAN while keeping `hostNetwork: false`.

This was one of the hardest problem & big efforts we pulled off during the entire benchmark series. Once we cracked this, everything went smooth you can check out the full step-by-step breakdown in [`pod-native-roce.md`](pod-native-roce.md) and [`progress.md`](progress.md).

We only had one week of access to this 16x H100 cluster, so I'm incredibly glad we got this connection set up by Day 2. Resolving this early gave us the full runway to experiment with disaggregated KV offloading, KEDA autoscaling, cross-node parallelism, and a ton more.

## What we benchmarked

> **Blog Series Incoming**: Detailed technical write-ups and benchmark deep-dives for these experiments are coming soon!

* **Aggregated vs. Disaggregated Scaling**: Decoupled Prefill & Decode (P/D) vs. aggregated serving across vLLM and SGLang.
* **KV-Aware Routing & CPU Offloading**: Evaluated prompt prefix caching vs. CPU KV offloading under high concurrency.
* **Parallelism Bottlenecks (TP / DP / EP)**: Analyzed cross-node network stalls (TP=16 across nodes) vs. EP/DP scalability.
* **Event-Driven Autoscaling (KEDA)**: Dynamic pod scaling (1–8 workers) based on queue depth and GPU load metrics.
* **NIXL RDMA Latency Profiling**: Measured KV transfer latency growth over RoCE v2 as context length scales. See the reusable [NIXL Prometheus and Grafana runbook](NIXL-grafana.md).

# The results

### 1. Baseline KV-Aware vs. KV-Aware + Offloading

We found that offloading really helps with improving overall performance it also handles significantly higher prefill KV transfer throughput (GB/s) than the baseline.

For the setup below, we ran CPU offloading with a HiCache ratio of 1.2 and up to 3.10 million tokens across 4 replicas (with each replica holding up to 3.10 million tokens). We tried with the `write_back` policy, which is much more efficient at handling CPU offloading than naive `write_through`.

We benchmarked this on sequence distribution `1024,256:35;4096,512:30;8192,1024:20;16384,512:10;32768,256:5` with a concurrency sweep of `8 16 32 64 96 128` and offloading GPU pressure to the CPU allows the GPU to focus more on compute intensive work instead of worrying about memory pressure, so it's clear that offloading helps you improve your throughput & overall performance!

You can see the results below:

### 2. Non-Parallelism (TP=1, 4P+4D) vs. Parallelism (TP=2, 2P+2D) on 8 GPUs

We found a really interesting take on Tensor Parallelism (`TP=1` vs. `TP=2`) when analyzing the AIPerf benchmark exports across concurrencies 1 to 128:

* **Low Concurrency (`c1`–`c8`) TP=2 wins on ITL**: at low loads, TP=2 performs better because splitting matrix operations across 2 GPUs speeds up per-token decode generation. At `c1`, TP=2 hits an ITL of **3.52ms** and **247.8 tok/s** throughput compared to TP=1 at **4.11ms** and **214.6 tok/s**.
* **The Tipping Point (`c16`)**: right around concurrency 16, TP=1 starts winning on prefill latency (TTFT of **228.7ms** vs **317.1ms** for TP=2), even though TP=2 still holds a tiny edge in total output throughput (**2,709.5 tok/s** vs **2,573.5 tok/s**).
* **High Concurrency (`c32`–`c128`) — TP=1 completely dominates**: under heavy load, TP=1 (4P+4D) scales way better because having 4 independent prefill workers avoids queuing delays and gets rid of inter-GPU All-Reduce communication overhead. By concurrency 128, TP=1 delivers **5x faster TTFT** (**604.5ms** vs **3,024.6ms**) and **31% higher overall throughput** (**9,435.7 tok/s** vs **7,201.8 tok/s**)!

So the trade-off is clear: `TP=2` gives lower streaming latency for individual requests under light load, but `TP=1 (4P+4D)` is far superior for high-concurrency throughput & prefill responsiveness! If your model fits on a single GPU and has enough room for KV cache, consider deploying it with `TP=1` to unlock significantly higher overall throughput!

You can see the benchmark comparison below:

### 3. Event-Driven Autoscaling using KEDA

We tried baseline event-driven autoscaling with KEDA on the **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B FP8** model (aggregated SGLang workers, TP=2), triggering scale-out based on the `dynamo_frontend_active_requests` metric (target threshold of 16 active requests per worker).

In our Grafana dashboard below, you can clearly see the classic startup gap during scale-out `HPA Desired` spikes first as load rises, `HPA Current` follows as KEDA requests new pods, and `Ready Pods` catches up once the engine finishes initializing even with a shared model-cache across nodes to avoid downloading weights from scratch, the SGLang engine still took its own time to load and warm up.

While we ran out of time to test separate autoscaling for disaggregated Prefill/Decode workers during our 1-week cluster window, the aggregated setup showed great event-driven scaling behavior!

### 4. Aggregated vs. Disaggregated Serving with Qwen3-32B FP8 (vLLM)

We ran five Qwen3-32B FP8 configurations with vLLM to see how worker topology, routing, and KV-cache policy affect serving performance. Starting from eight aggregated TP=2 workers, we compared 6P2D and 4P4D disaggregation, then added KV-aware routing and CPU KV-cache offloading while keeping the model, workload, GPU count, and AIPerf SLO definitions aligned.

The 4P4D setting with KV-aware configuration delivered the strongest observed balance of per-GPU output throughput, SLO-qualified goodput, and request pass rate.

Note: Exp 5 is provisional because 201 requests returned no generated content.

</p>

The aggregated and 6P2D round-robin configurations developed very large TTFT tails, while the 4P4D KV-aware configuration had the largest share of requests within the SLO target.
